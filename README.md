# Balenciaga-e-website
 Balenciaga is a fashion house founded by Crist√≥bal Balenciaga, a Basque designer, born in the Basque Country, Spain. He had a reputation as a couturier of unbending standards and was referred to as "the master of us all" by Christian Dior. His bubble skirts and odd, feminine, yet ultra-modern shapes were trademarks of the house. The house of Balenciaga is now owned by the French multinational company PPR.
